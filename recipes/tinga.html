    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tinga is a typical Mexican dish made with shredded meat (chicken, pork, or beef) in a sauce made from tomato, onion, garlic, and chipotle pepper. It is usually consumed on a tostada, taco, quesadilla, or molote, accompanied by avocado, fresh cheese, chopped lettuce, cream, or radish.</p>
    <p>It is a simple dish, very popular in the center of the country and very versatile; there are tinga dishes made with tuna, grouper, or other fish, and also vegetarian tinga recipes made with carrots, sweet potato, or mushrooms. In Morelos, for example, it is typical to eat tinga made with cazahuate mushrooms. In Edomex, you can find tinga made with green chorizo. In Tlaxcala, it usually includes chorizo or longaniza and potatoes. However, the most popular tinga in all of Mexico is chicken tinga. In some homes, chicken and beef or pork meats are mixed.</p>
