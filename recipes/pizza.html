    <h2>Ingredients (Dough)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup of warm water</li>
        <li>1 tbs yeast</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup of flour, 1/4 cup aditional for managing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large, deep container, put the yeast and 2 tablespoons of hot water and mix well. Let it sit for a few minutes. (Bubbles should form.) Note: if nothing happens after 10-15 minutes, start again. Once the bubbles appear, add the rest of the warm water, the salt, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Divide the flour into 1/2 cups. 1/4 of the flour should be left over. With a wooden spoon, add 1/2 cup of flour to the yeast water. Stir well. Add another 1/2 cup and stir again. When adding the last 1/2 cup of flour, the dough should become a bit hard and difficult to stir. If it is not, add another 1/4 cup of flour and stir.</li>
        <li>When the dough is firm enough to continue stirring, place it on a clean surface and knead it for 7 minutes. If the dough is a bit sticky, you can sprinkle it with a little flour.</li>
        <li>Put a little olive oil in a bowl. Place the dough on the oil until it is covered. Cover with a damp towel and let it rise until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has doubled in size, knead it again and refrigerate it for 6-8 hours to let it rise again.</li>
        <li>After 6-8 hrs in the refrigerator, the dough can be used. Cut the dough into the number of pizzas you plan to prepare and shape them into pizzas. Let them come to room temperature before baking.</li>
        <li>Add the ingredients you want and bake for 12-15 minutes at 500 F (260Â° C).</li>
    </ol>
