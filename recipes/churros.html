    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cinnamon-sugar topped fried pastry dough stick, they're similar to doughnuts, but they have ridges because they are piped out of a pastry bag. Because they are fried instead of baked, churros have a fluffy and tender interior with a satisfyingly crispy exterior.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>800ml water</li>
        <li>200g butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>400g sifted flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>15g sugar</li>
        <li>5g salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the flavored water:</strong><br>
            Infuse a large cinnamon stick in 1 liter of water and bring it to a boil. Once boiled, strain it, but only use <strong>800 milliliters</strong>. Precision matters.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Preheat the mixing bowl:</strong><br>
            Use the same bowl that you'll knead the dough in. This helps keep the temperature steady, partially cooking the dough before adding flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Combine the liquids and flavorings:</strong><br>
            Add the cinnamon water, butter, salt, sugar, and vanilla to the bowl. Bring to a boil to fully integrate the flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Incorporate the flour:</strong><br>
            Add the <strong>sifted flour</strong> to the boiling mixture. Stir constantly to fully integrate it, making sure there are no clumps to avoid splattering during frying.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cool slightly before adding eggs:</strong><br>
            Let the dough cool a bit to prevent the eggs from scrambling or changing the dough's texture.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the eggs:</strong><br>
            Beat the eggs thoroughly before incorporating them into the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mix in the eggs gradually:</strong><br>
            Add the eggs little by little, fully incorporating each addition before adding more.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Knead the dough:</strong><br>
            Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead briefly. The dough should be soft but not sticky.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Shape the churros:</strong><br>
            Use a <strong>piping bag with a 1M star tip</strong> to pipe long strips of dough and cut to size. A traditional churro press is not necessary for this soft dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fry the churros:</strong><br>
            Heat oil to <strong>170–180°C (340–355°F)</strong>. Fry the churros for about <strong>5 minutes</strong>, or until golden and crispy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong><br>
            Remove from the oil, drain, and enjoy your perfectly crispy churros!
        </li>
