    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp corn flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>&frac12; tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups warm milk</li>
        <li>50g melted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs, separating the yolks from the whites. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Preheat a non-stick pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, egg yolks, and melted butter to the dry ingredients and mix gently; it's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter using a spatula, incorporating them with slow, circular motions from the bottom up to retain as much air as possible.</li>
        <li>Pour a portion of the batter onto the preheated pan and cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the edges start to set. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your choice of toppings and beverages.</li>
    </ol>
